    Step 1: In this step, we want to estimate the cost required to set-up the product/service industry. This step is specific to the topic at hand and would differ massively between, for example, LLM subscription business and Airline per say
    Example A - Platform Development for LLM Subscription
    -	Front-end and Back-end of Website
    	Assumption: Platform Front-end and Back-end Fee 
    	Formula = Platform Front-end + Back-end Fee

    	Assumption: Set-up and Integration Fee for Platform APIs and Data Sources 
    	Formula = Set-up and Integration Fee for Platform APIs and Data Sources
    -	Model Training AND FINE-TUNING COST

    Let's think step-by-step. Do not solve equations, only write step-by-step formula. Keep the formula compact. Keep units on left side of equations. If there is any unnecessy steps which is not used any where remove it, don't use it in formula.
