Given description: {User_descriptions} your task is to Identify the size of the population in scope, such as number of total households, number of total enterprises, number of total seats, number of adopters. The objective of this step is to gauge the each sample space of the demand side for a certain service across the distinct customer dimensions such as low-income / Mid-income / High-income.  If the calculation is structured by continent and the company operates only in specific countries, make sure that only the continents corresponding to these countries are only considered in writing formula.
    The calculation should only use the mathematical operations. Define each step clearly, provide the formula for intermediate calculations, and explain how each step contributes to the estimation of the size of the population in scope. Ensure each step's resultant variable have proper unit (e.g., "User_base (millions) = ...").

    you have to only write first step for user base estimation, in this we want to Identify the size of the population in each scope.
    

    you have to follow this directions for first Step of User-Base Estimation Framework to write formula
    Step 1: Identify the size of the population in scope, such as number of total households, number of total enterprises, number of total seats, number of total masts. The objective of this step is to gauge the total sample space of the demand side for a certain service across the distinct customer dimensions such as low-income / Mid-income / High-income.
    Example: 
    1.	If we are to open a dog servicing business and we need to identify the sample size of dogs: 
      a) this step would get to the total number of population households
      b) then, the households get broken down by the income groups, i.e., low, mid, and income
      c) then, for each income group, we multiply the number of dogs owned by income group
    2.	If we are to open a B2C LLM subscriptions Business
      a) this step would get to identify the total global population
      b) then, segment population by LLM/AI adoption levels, i.e., not adopters, low, medium, high
    3.	If we are to open a car tires sales enterprise:
      a) this step would get to the total number of population households
      b) then, the households get broken down by the income groups, i.e., low, mid, and income
      c) then, for each income group, we multiply the number of cars owned and their tires by income group
    4.	If we are to open a digital bank which provides cards and loans
      a) This step would get to the total number of population
      b) then, the population gets broken down by age group 
      c) then, for each age group, we identify the percentage adoption
    5.	If we are to launch a premium economy business line
      a) This step would get to the size the total population
      b) Then breakdown down by income group
      c) Then breakdown each income group by which class of service they opt for, i.e., business, economy, first
      d) Then breakdown likelihood to open for premium economy
    
    Requirements: 
    -	Maintain the breakdown to be by market (e.g., continent, country of operation such as UK, UAE). if only one market, then only the customer segments get retained thereafter in the format. 
    -   If the calculations are structured by continent and the company operates in specific countries, ensure that the continents corresponding to these countries are only included.

        Latin and Central America
        â€¢	Low Income Group

    If we have only one continent
    â€¢	Low Income Group

    In terms of continents, we only possess the following:
    -	North America

    Example: 
    f.	If the global population was referenced, then total growth rate would be as per global historical data
    g.	If the global enterprises were referenced, then total growth rate would be as per global historical data
    h.	If the seats are referenced, then would be considered flat. Model the growth rate but assume it to be zero
    Note: Growth rate would typically range between 2-3% year-on-year
    As such, Step 2 would have the output of the total demand side including the growth rate.

    Step 3: Define the company market share of how its growth would shape up in terms of acquisition across the net demand identified post step 2. The objective is to size the competitive position from the demand side of the idea at hand.
    Example: 
    1)	If we are to open a dog servicing business, and we have identified in step 2 the net demand to be 1Mn dogs across each of the three income groups, then we need to multiply the market share for each income group to identify the size of the market adoption required. Such as,

    3)	B: Medium Income Dogs: 1,000,000

    j.	If we are to open a B2C LLM subs Business, and we have identified in step 2 the net demand to be 10Mn people across each of the four adoption levels, then we need to multiply the market share for each level to identify the size of the market adoption required. Such as,

    ii.	B: Medium Adopters: 10,000,000

Here I am interested in identifying in every period the loss of product users due to lower competitive advantage or to bad quality of service. This would eventually be subtracted from the outcome of step 3 where the formula would be: captured demand * (1-churn rate). The analysis should be broken down by demand group, as such
    -	For each Low / Medium / High Income group: Net captured demand = captured demand * (1-churn)
    -	For each Low / Medium / High adopters: Net captured demand = captured demand * (1-churn)
