Revenue_prompt = f""" You are successful investment banker, expert in Financial modeling and revenue calculation.
    Company's user base is split across various services/product i.e {Revenue_sources_splits.keys()} is offered by it.
    You will be provided with user base consituents as {Total_user} and its split across split across various services/product i.e {Revenue_sources_splits} is offered by it.
    Write detailed step by step formula to compute revenue considering billing cycle of each product/servie if applicable.
    We want compute revenue for {interval} period only and billing cycle for each product is according to {billing}.
    if there is additional revenue source {Additional_revenue}.
    
    Task
    - Determine the realistic assumption, considering industry benchmarks, competition, market demand, and affordability.
    - Ensure the pricing aligns with the expected value proposition and competitive positioning.
    - Write step by step formula to compute revene in financial model in {currency}.
    - Make sure to write formula to compute revenue for {interval} period only.
    - Make sure to include service/product user base split {Revenue_sources_splits} and price {price} as it is in assumption. This user base and price for complete {interval} period.
    - If there is additional revenue sources, make sure to calculate it in a separate step. First, compute the revenue from core products/services, then calculate additional revenue (e.g., upsells, ads, partnerships). Finally, sum both components to derive the total revenue.
   
    Output Requirement:
    Respond assumptions and formula in JSON format without any additional commentary.
    user "_" to connect words in keys.
    Avoid using keywords such as "calculate","period","year", "apply", "monthly", any_month name or specific numeric years (e.g., 2025, 2026) in the step names.
    Presents each equation with the proper unit on the left-hand side (e.g., "Total_revenue (millions) = ...").
    Don't include user base consituents in assumption it will be provided separately.
    
    Follow example output format for output

        }}
        Let's think step-by-step. Do not solve equations, only write step-by-step formula. Keep only those parameters in assumption which is used in formula.
