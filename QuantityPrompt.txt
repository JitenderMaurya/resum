Enhanced 6-Step User-Base Estimation Framework
Step 1: Define the Total Addressable Market across the markets in scope 
Step 2: Segment the Customer Base into the distinct customer segments
Note: If we are having different countries, then take the different countries or continents as the breakers, under each let’s have the different customer segments. 
Customer segments mean: 
-	High income / Low Income / Medium Income. 
-	Prepaid / post-paid / business
-	Economy class / Business class / First class
-	Standard / Premium
For example: 
India / Indian Subcontinent
-	Prepaid
-	Postpaid
-	Business
UK / UK and Europe 
-	Prepaid
-	Postpaid
-	Business
If only one market, then only the customer segments get retained thereafter in the format.
In terms of continents, we only possess the following:
-	North America
-	Latin and Central America
-	UK and Europe
-	Middle East and Africa 
-	Indian Subcontinent (i.e., India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan)
-	Asian Pacific (i.e., China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.)
Step 3: Identify serviceable addressable market (SAM) 
-	Multiply the output of Step #2 by an adoption factor to create SAM 
Step 4: Identify the company acquisition rates
-	Multiple the SAM with the acquisition rate YoY
Step 5: Factor gains and losses of customers from and to competitors
Here this step would include two pieces: 
-	Factor from the total SAM, how many can the company gain from competitors (Adds)
-	Factor of the acquired customers, how many churn per year (subtracts)
Step 6: Calculate the total user base by customer segment
-	Here this would be: 
o	Output of Step 4 + the gain – the churn per segment
o	Then total = Market A (segment 1 + segment 2 + segment N) + Market B ((segment 1 + segment 2 + segment N)


User Base Estimation Standardization:
Prompt 1 – Overview: I want a financial model which estimates the financial plan for a dog servicing business. The business is expected to have only operations in Dubai and is expected to provide 3 services. The financial plan should be for 4 years and should factor in the capex of setting up a dog hotel for one of the services.
Prompt 1 – Follow-up: What revenue products should be factored into the financial model?
The three services are: Dog Walking, Dog Grooming, Hotel Sleeping per night
Prompt 1 – User Base Steps:
Step 1: Define total addressable market in Dubai
Step 2: Split the total addressable market into segments
Step 3: Identify serviceable addressable market (SAM)
Step 4: Identify the company acquisition rates
Step 5: X
Step 6: X
Prompt 1 – User Base Formulae:
Step 1: Define total addressable market in Dubai
-	Total Population of Dubai = 4Mn
-	Number of Households of Dubai = Total Population / households per population = 1Mn
Step 2: Split the total addressable market into segments
-	High Income segment TAM: Total households * share high income * high_income_dogs_per_household
-	Medium Income segment TAM: Total households * share Mid income * Mid_income_dogs_per_household
-	Low Income segment TAM: Total households * share low income * low_income_dogs_per_household
Step 3: Identify serviceable addressable market (SAM)
-	High-income SAM: High-income segment TAM * Highincome_Share where dogs would be serviced
-	Mid-income SAM: Mid-income segment TAM * Mid income_Share where dogs would be serviced
-	Low-income SAM: Low-income segment TAM * Low income_Share where dogs would be serviced
Step 4: Identify the company acquisition rates
-	High income acquisition: High income SAM * Highincome_Acquisition
-	Mid income acquisition: Mid income SAM * Mid income_Acquisition
-	Low income acquisition: Low income SAM * Low income_Acquisition
Step 5: Factor gains and losses of customers from and to competitors
-	High income gains: High Income SAM * High Income gain per annum
-	High income Loss: High Income acquisition * High_Income Churn per annum
-	Mid income gains: Mid Income SAM * Mid Income gain per annum
-	Mid income Loss: Mid Income acquisition * Mid_Income Churn per annum
-	Low income gains: Low Income SAM * Low Income gain per annum
-	Low income Loss: Low Income acquisition * Low_Income Churn per annum
Step 6: Calculate the total user base by customer segment
High Income = acquisition + gains – losses
Mid Income = acquisition + gains – losses
Low Income = acquisition + gains - losses
Total = High + Mid + Low

Prompt 1: 
I want to set-up a financial model to estimate the business case of launching a new digital payments gateway for an airline. for that, what would be key is to have the ability to measure the incremental revenue achieved by continent versus the increase in cost of sales per pax. the period of the assessment is 5 years, with the need to include last 2 years of historicals to compare the per unit sales costs.

In this prompt, we specify that we structure the user base sizing by continent which would impact the revenues which would as well be structured by continent. costs and other items do not matter here because it is a comparison on a total cost of sales basis as mentioned

we however, do not specify the markets / continents of operation

we do not provide an overview of what the new gateway is or to whom it appeals the most

Prompt 2: 
I want to set-up a financial model where i project the impact of adding a product on my baseline for the next 3 years. 

we do not specify the product, we do not specify the market, we do not specify the country of operations. 

follow-up questions? answers include:
- in which market does your company operate? we sell tires
- what is the new product? assume it is a new wheel product
- which locations do you serve? we only work in india
if the answer was only India, we need to ask about their coverage in India - i.e., tier 1 / tier 2 / tier 3 cities

note: in instances like this where the term used "check impact on revenue baseline"- we typically have a scenario switch: New Product Launched, Without Product Launched

I want to open a new third mobile network operator in Oman to compete with Omantel and Ooredoo. The financial plan should estimate the size of the opportunity and its expected return as investors won’t invest for a rate of return which is less than 9.5%. The financial plan should be for 5 years. 
Prompt 3 – Follow-up: What revenue products should be factored into the financial model?
SIM Cards, Voice and Data pay-as-you-go, and Mobile re-selling

Prompt 4 – Overview: I want to open a new fintech start-up, namely a digital bank with two type of services: cards and loans. I want to assess the opportunity of launching from Riyadh, mainly serving the domestic market as well as the GCC captive market. The financial model should be for three years.
Prompt 4 – Follow-up: What revenue products should be factored into the financial model?
Two types of Cards: Standard and Premium, and Islamic loans as required
