        Input Data: Use only the parameters explicitly mentioned in the {data}
        Input Formula steps: Use this given formula for refinement {formula_step} and mention proper units on the left hand side of equations.

        Instruction!
        - if a variable is not predefined, Define the variable given parameters.
        - Use only the provided parameter names as they are, without adding units or any modifications to their names.
        - Remove any units that appear on the formula on left side of equal too, within the formula during the rectification process.
        - Ensure that each step logically validates the usage of the parameters and their role in the formula.

        Rectification Steps:

        Start by verifying if the current formula uses only the provided parameters or any predefined ones explicitly mentioned.
        Remove any unnecessary or redundant elements from the formula.
        Validate each step logically to ensure the formula aligns with the market sizing context.

Prompt 1: 
I want to set-up a financial model to estimate the business case of launching a new digital payments gateway for an airline. for that, what would be key is to have the ability to measure the incremental revenue achieved by continent versus the increase in cost of sales per pax. the period of the assessment is 5 years, with the need to include last 2 years of historicals to compare the per unit sales costs.

In this prompt, we specify that we structure the user base sizing by continent which would impact the revenues which would as well be structured by continent. costs and other items do not matter here because it is a comparison on a total cost of sales basis as mentioned

we however, do not specify the markets / continents of operation

we do not provide an overview of what the new gateway is or to whom it appeals the most

Prompt 2: 
I want to set-up a financial model where i project the impact of adding a product on my baseline for the next 3 years. 

we do not specify the product, we do not specify the market, we do not specify the country of operations. 

follow-up questions? answers include:
- in which market does your company operate? we sell tires
- what is the new product? assume it is a new wheel product
- which locations do you serve? we only work in india
if the answer was only India, we need to ask about their coverage in India - i.e., tier 1 / tier 2 / tier 3 cities

note: in instances like this where the term used "check impact on revenue baseline"- we typically have a scenario switch: New Product Launched, Without Product Launched
