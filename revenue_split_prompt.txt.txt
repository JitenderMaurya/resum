Your task is to break down the company’s user base across different plan tenures—such as monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and yearly subscriptions—based on realistic business assumptions.

    You need to think and decide which product/services can have different plans/subscription based on realistic assumptions.
    In this step you have to write formula to breakdown user base for {interval} period.  
    For example, if you are breaking for yearly period and the subscription can have maximum 4 plans: monthly, quarterly, halfyearly, and yearly, then the expectation is to breakdown the user base by each
    For example, if you are breaking for halfyearly period and the subscription can have maximum 3 plans: monthly, quarterly and halfyearly, then the expectation is to breakdown the user base by each
    For example, if you are breaking for quarterly period and the subscription can have maximum 2 plans: monthly and quarterly, then the expectation is to breakdown the user base by each
    For example, if you are breaking for monthly period and the subscription can have maximum 1 plans: monthly, then the expectation is to breakdown the user base by only monthly

    Write detailed step by step formula to compute discounts considering billing cycle of each product/servie if applicable.
    Billing cycle for each product is according to billing description provided as {billing}.
    
    ##TASK
    We are writing 5 step process to compute revenue for a company. Your task is to write third step given first and second step. 
    In this third step we Identify the pricing rate for each product/servicese by plan tenure.   
    you have to follow this directions for third Step to write formula
    
    Step 3: In this step, Identify the pricing rate for each product/services plan offered.
    In this step you have to write formula to Identify the pricing rate for {interval} interval period.  
    Identify the pricing rate for each product/services tenure plans offered in a duration. Typically, we factor for pricing discounts in case anyone is doing any discounting to their product/services driven by seasons.
	Example:
    -	If a company provides discounts for 2 months by 25%, and the original price is USD 100 and claculuation is done for yearly period
    -	Then, the yearly_Discounted_price = [original_price * (fix_num - discount_months) + original_price * (discount_months) * (100% - discount_rate) ] / fix_num
    - halfyearly_Discounted_price = [original_price * (fix_num - discount_months) + original_price * (discount_months) * (100% - discount_rate) ] / fix_num
    - quarterly_Discounted_price = [original_price * (fix_num - discount_months) + original_price * (discount_months) * (100% - discount_rate) ] / fix_num
    Where discount_months = 2 in the example above
    Discount_rate = 25% in the example above
    
    Note: this above formula is for yearly period calculations.
    If the model is for halfyearly, quarterly, monthly, etc. then the discount for each period would be applied as necessary. In other words:
    for halfyearly period, dicounted_Price = [100 * (fix_num - discount_months) + 100 * (discount_months) * (100% - discount_rate)] / fix_num
    for quaterly period, dicounted_Price = [100 * (fix_num - discount_months) + 100 * (discount_months) * (100% - discount_rate)] / fix_num
    
    if interval period is yearly, keep fix_num = 12 for monthly, quarterly, halfyearly and yearly tenure plans
    if interval period is halfyearly, keep fix_num = 6 for monthly, quarterly and halfyearly tenure plans
    if interval period is quarterly,keep fix_num = 3 for monthly and quarterly tenure plans
        
    ## Requirements
    - make sure to add step 3 assumption in step 1 and step 2 assumptions
    - Make sure to write formula to compute discounted price for each {price.keys()} using above explanations
    - Respond in JSON format and ensure to shows measurement units of each key values.
    - When writing the step-by-step formula, please represent numbers without commas (e.g., use 1000000 instead of 1,000,000).
    - Don't use year name in assigning any key names in formula

     revenue_prompt_step5 = f"""you are a successful investment banker with deep expertise in financial modeling and revenue computation. Your task is to write formula to calculate total revenue from each product/services using fromula step 4.
    You will be provided with user requirement as {user_description} and period = {interval}. 
    Also, You will be provided with step 1, step 2, step 3 and step 4 as {step4}. Step 1 computed user across various product/services offered, step 2 computed user across various tenure plans, step 3 computed discounted price for each product/service for various tenure plans available and step 4 computed revenue from each product/services offering.
    Company's user base is split across various services/product i.e {Revenue_sources_splits.keys()} is offered by it.
    You will be provided with user base consituents as {Total_user.keys()} and its user base value across various segments as {Total_user}.
    Write detailed step by step formula to compute revenue for each product/services, considering billing cycle of each product/servie if applicable.
    Billing cycle for each product is according to billing description provided as {billing}.
    if there is additional revenue source information provided i.e {Additional_revenue}, include it.
    
    ##TASK
    We are writing 5 step process to compute revenue for a company. Your task is to write fifth step given first, second, third and fourth step. 
    In this step we Calculate the total revenue from product/services.   
    you have to follow this directions for fifth Step to write formula
    
    Step 4: In this step, Calculate the total revenue from product/services plan offered.
    In this step you have to write formula to Calculate the total revenue for {interval} interval period.  
    Calculate the Toatl revenue from product/services offered in the duration.
    Typically, we will add revenue obtained from each product/services obtained in step 4 and compute the additional revenue, Finally sum it to obtain total revenue for the company.  
   
    ## Requirements
    - make sure to add step 5 assumption in step 1, step 2, step 3 and step 4 assumptions
    - Make sure to write formula to compute total revenue
    - Respond in JSON format and ensure to shows measurement units of each key values.
    - When writing the step-by-step formula, please represent numbers without commas (e.g., use 1000000 instead of 1,000,000).
    - Don't use year name in assigning any key names in formula 
    - Make sure that the step names do not use keywords such as numeric year(eg: 2025, 2026 etc), "explore", "calculate" or "apply."
    - Includes clear intermediate steps for calculating key values with proper units on the left hand side of the equations
    - Follow the example output format provided below
    - dont include "[]" bracket in formula, if required use "()" bracket
    - If user base is computed for only monthly period then user across each service belongs to monthly period only.
    - You can update previous steps formula but make sure to add or remove assumptions parameters accordingly
    - Make sure to remove unnecessary steps from the formula which is not used any where to compute total revenue
